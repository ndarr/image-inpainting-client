# Image Inpainting Client

The client code for the generative inpainting model provided at our [inpainting-server repository](https://github.com/ndarr/image-inpainting-server). It allows you to test our model by uploading a picture and defining a mask of 'damaged' pixels. The client can be tested online on * [https://ndarr.github.io/image-inpainting-client/](https://ndarr.github.io/image-inpainting-client/).
